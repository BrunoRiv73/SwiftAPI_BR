SwiftAPI by Bruno Rivera - A01571663

In this API, the user will be able to see detailed information regarding the Star Wars films and some of the planets and starships that appear in said films.
The app does this by connecting to the following endpoints:

- Films: https://swapi.info/api/films
- Planets: https://swapi.info/api/planets
- Starships: https://swapi.info/api/starships

The app obtains the information from these endpoints, and displays them in a DetailView, from which the user can see more detailed information about the
Star Wars films, planets, or starships, such as the climate of a planet, or the cost in credits of a starship.

In order to run the app, the user must ensure that their Xcode application is updated to Version 16.4 or onward. Then, 
if the user wants to gain optimal use from the app, it is advised that they use the iPhone 16 canvas, as the app was developed with that view in mind.
After that, the user must ensure that they have an internet connection to be able to connect to the API, as a message error will appear if the connection is unsuccessful.
If the user wants to run the app on their personal iPhone or iPad, they must connect the laptop and the mobile device with a cable, activate Developer tools in the mobile device,
and finally create a build in Xcode so that the app is in their iPhone or iPad.
